                Located at the site of the Bey Lea golf course in Toms River N.J., Shogun Legacy
                (formerly Shogun Bey Lea) offers a unique dining experience from a menu of
                contemporary Asian and traditional sushi & sashimi dishes in an elegant, upscale
                setting.
                <br /><br />
                For the last 10 years, Shogun Legacy operated under the name of Shogun Bey Lea and
                served a full spectrum of Japanese cuisine. Shogun Bey Lea was closed in mid-April at
                which time extensive renovations were undertaken. The new Shogun Legacy
                represents the evolution of the restaurant from a Hibachi Steak House and Sushi Bar to
                a ﬁne dining establishment offering a comprehensive selection of Asian and Thai
                entrees to compliment the selection of traditional sushi and sashimi dishes previously
                offered.
                <br /><br />
                The new Shogun Legacy boasts an elegant new main dining room, a new, larger sushi
                bar, a private dining room for corporate events, private parties and other special
                occasions and a newly renovated bar and dining area located on the outdoor deck. To
                compliment the new menu selections, a wine cellar has been added enabling customers
                to pair their dining entrees with a wide selection of vintage wines to further enhance
                their overall dining experience.
                <br /><br />
                Shogun Legacy’s new chef brings a new sense of creativity and originality to the design
                of Legacy’s new menu. The menu selections are unique and represent some of the
                ﬁnest Asian cuisine available in Central New Jersey. An experienced and attentive
                service staff will afford customers a truly unique and enjoyable dining experience.
